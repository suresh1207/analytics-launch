### Story

After setting up our website, we now want to make sure that new Profile data (from sign-ups) and behavioral ExperienceEvent data (browsing habits, actionable triggers, etc) are recorded and updated in near real-time. We can do this by utilizing Adobe Experience Platform Launch on our website. For this exercise, we will step into the shoes of the owners of La Boutique, a fashion retail website, and see how we can bring in behavioral and profile data from website interactions into Experience Platform.
