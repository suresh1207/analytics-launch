## Exercise 1.5: Install the La Boutique Mobile Application
In this exercise, the goal is to install and use the "La Boutique" Mobile Application.

The "La Boutique"-mobile application is a variation of the "Luma"-application which was built by Mathieu Hannouz from the Evangelist-team. If you're looking for the source-code of the app, you can find it here: [https://git.corp.adobe.com/hannouz/Luma-Platform-iOS](https://git.corp.adobe.com/hannouz/Luma-Platform-iOS)
