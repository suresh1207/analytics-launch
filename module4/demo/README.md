### Exercise 4.4 - Walkthrough of Demo Scenario, now including Alexa

Below is a standard script to walk through the demo scenario in the context of Luma Retail. The same script can be applied to any other brand of choice, like La Boutique or your own custom brand.

The goal of this exercise is to get to know the standard path to demo the SYTYCD-environment including the Alexa skill that you just built, and to use the below demo script in combination with the personalized demo website that you built in Module 3.

It's now time to use your own custom, personalized demo environment and follow the below script.

**FYI:** This exercise is not optional and is a requirement to have access to future enablement content.

To be clear, the video needs to show:

  * Showcase your customized demo environment for a brand of choice, now including Alexa.
  * Follow the demo script here
  * Only video is required, sound is not required.

Please upload your video in a service of choice (Youtube Unlisted Video, Dropbox, Sharepoint, ...) and post your name, email address and link to the video [here](https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/expplatformemea/SYTYCD+-+Module+4%3A+Alexa+Video+Submissions).

#### **Demo flow:**

#### Step 1 - Unknown visitor browses the Luma website

  * Go to the Luma Homepage
  
  ![Demo](./images/lb_home.png)
  
  * Introduce the X-ray panel and explain the Real-Time Customer Profile:
    * **ECID** as the internal Adobe identifier
    * **Audience Manager ID** as the external identifier, and stress the importance and unique role of Audience Manager as the door and gateway between the internal 'owned' world and the external, paid media world.

  ![Demo](./images/lb_els_dtl.png)
  
  * Have a look at the product, explain that an Experience Event of type ```Product View``` has been sent to Platform and then click on the ```+ Add To Cart``` - button.
  
  ![Demo](./images/lb_addtocart.png)
  
  * Explain that an Experience Event of type ```Add To Cart``` has been sent to Platform. Next, click on the cart icon in the top right corner of your screen to visualize the cart.
  
  ![Demo](./images/lb_cart.png)

  ![Demo](./images/lb_cartee.png)
  
  * While the behaviour is anonymous, Luma is able to track every click and store in in Platform. Once the anonymous customer becomes known, Luma will be able to merge all anonymous behaviour automatically to the know profile.
  
#### Step 2 - Unknown visitor registers on the Luma website

As a best practice, please use the following convention for identifiers:

  * Email Address identifier: **ldap**+**DDMMYY**-**number**@adobetest.com
  * Mobile Nr identifier: **yourmobilenumber**-**DDMMYY**-**number**

As an example, for the ldap ```vangeluw```:
On Monday June 17 2019, this should be the first set of identifiers of the day.
  
  * Email Address identifier: **vangeluw**+**17062019**-**1**@adobetest.com
  * Mobile Nr identifier: **0473622044**-**17062019**-**1**

  * Go to the Login/Register page
  
  ![Demo](./images/lb_register.png)
  
  ATTENTION: please remember [the Platform Demo Best Practices guidelines](./ex5.md)
  
  ![Demo](./images/lb_register_dtl.png) 
 
  * Fill out your registration details and opt-in preferences and click ```CREATE ACCOUNT```.
  
  * After login, go to the Homepage of the Luma website and open the X-ray panel, go to Real-Time Customer Profile. On the X-ray panel, you should see all of your personal data displayed.
