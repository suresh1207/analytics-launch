## Installing Adobe Experience Platform on Unifi (FYI only)
In this section, the goal is to configure everything that is needed to connect Adobe Experience Platform with Unifi.

| Please note:                |
| :-------------------------- |
| The steps described on this section are for informational purpose only. The integration is already configured on the Unifi instance that you will be using to complete the exercises to follow. 
**You do NOT need to configure this again**|

### Create your Adobe I/O integration

Go to <a href="https://git.corp.adobe.com/vangeluw/platformenablement/blob/master/module2/prerequisites/ex1.md" target="_blank">Module 2 - Exercise 2.1.1</a> and follow the steps there to configure your Adobe I/O integration. 

In case you already have an existing integration in place you are able to use that as well.
