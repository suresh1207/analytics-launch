## Unifi Overview

The Unifi Data Platform is the solution for self-service data and business intelligence. The Unifi Data Platform allows you to:

* Discover, organize, and catalog your data, wherever it is located, in whatever form it is in.
* Prepare your data. The Unifi Data Platform provides AI tools that simplify the jobs to just a few clicks.
* Secure, protect and manage access to your data by role, and by dataset, row, and column. 

The Unifi Data Platform helps the enterprise more quickly and accurately discover, acquire, and transform your data so that it can be combined with existing data and analyzed using business intelligence and visualization tools to extract business insights.

The Unifi Data Platform provides a browser-based data integration software solution. The Unifi platform runsas a client to the data store. Users interact with the Unifi platform through a self-service graphical user interface.

With the Unifi Data Platform, business analysts can select and integrate their data sets without having to write code or involve IT personnel. This allows the analyst to pursue “what if” scenarios with the data and develop business insights much more quickly than with traditional hand-coded programming.

The Unifi Data Platform is a data integration platform built natively on top of the Hadoop ecosystem. It uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as the data store and works with various Hadoop execution components including Hive and MapReduce for data transformation.
