## Exercise 2.4: Using the new, Unified Segmentation Experience
In this exercise, the goal is to use the new segmentation experience that is available within Adobe Experience Platform

The new, unified segmentation experience is available through both the UI of Platform, as by making use of Adobe I/O and the API's of Adobe Experience Platform. In this exercise, we'll use both approaches to build a segment.

### [Exercise 2.4.1 - Create a Segment Definition through the Platform UI](./ex1.md)
In this exercise, you'll create a new Segment Defintion by making use of the new UI in Platform.

### [Exercise 2.4.2: Create a segment through the Platform API](./ex2.md)
In this exercise, you'll use Adobe I/O and Platform API's to create a new Segment Definition, run the Segment Job and store the result of the Segment Job as a new dataset in Platform.
