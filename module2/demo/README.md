## Exercise 2.5: Walkthrough of Demo Scenario
In this exercise, the goal is to make all elements come together and use the La Boutique website with the Xray-panel, the La Boutique mobile application, together with a call center application and a POS-application to tell an impactful story to your customer that bridges the gap between online and offline, in real-time.

### Demo Best Practices

You're working in a real Platform environment with real datasets. From a demo perspective, this impacts what you should do before and/or after every demo.

First and foremost: every time you open a web browser or mobile app and go to the register/login page, an ID-sync is made between your ECID, your email address and your mobile phone number. This is the way Platform is supposed to work so it's expected behaviour, but from a demo perspective this means that if you do a demo and want to tell a story to a customer, you'll have to make sure to always start your demo story with a clean account and environment, which means:

  * **a clean, new email-address**
  * **a clean, new mobile phone number**
  * **a clean, fresh browser environment with a clean ECID**
  * **a clean, new mobile app environment**

Failure to do any of the above means that you will start the demo story with a 'dirty' profile, and as such, your demo story will be influenced in impredictable ways.

Before you start exercise 2.5.1, please go through exercise 2.5.0 and bookmark this page as you'll need it in the future for all future demo's.

### [Exercise 2.5.0 - Demo Best Practices](./ex0.md)
In this exercise, you'll learn what to do before a live customer demo to make sure that you're starting with a fresh profile and environment.

### [Exercise 2.5.1 - From unknown to known on the La Boutique website](./ex1.md)
In this exercise, let's talk about the journey from unknown to known on the "La Boutique"-website.

### [Exercise 2.5.2: Cross-device on Mobile App](./ex2.md)
After becoming a known customer, it's time to link the "La Boutique"-mobile app to the Unified Profile and see the Unified Profile do what it does, in real-time.

### [Exercise 2.5.3: Personal advice in the brick-and-mortar store](./ex3.md)
Today's experiences are increasingly personalised in the online world, but wouldn't it be awesome to be as personal and relevant in an offline context?

### [Exercise 2.5.4: Questions or problems? Call the Call Center!](./ex4.md)
A call center is typically an environment that you reach out to when something has gone wrong, or when you've got a problem. Therefor, call center employees need to have all information about you as a customer at their disposal. This should include behavioral data, in real-time and also, ML-powered insights. Platform is now able to provide real-time access to browsing behavior in any 'offline'-environment, in real-time.

### [Exercise 2.5.5: Troubleshooting Data Ingestion and Validation Errors](./ex5.md)
During demo preparation and testing, it's possible that you'll encounter problems with data ingestion. If your Profile data or your Products Viewed data isn't visible on the X-ray panel in real-time, it's very likely that you have an issue with the data that you're sending to Platform. When data arrives in Platform, there are a number of mechanisms that validate data prior to ingesting it. In this exercise, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot these errors yourself by using Postman to query Adobe Experience Platform's API's.
